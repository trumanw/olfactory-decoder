# olfactory-decoder
A library to train/predict smell of molecular compounds and potentially discover new fragrance.

# Introduction
The project is inspired by the [AIcrowd Learning 2 Smell Challenge](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/learning-to-smell).

This library will provide 3 main functions:
- A bunch of molecular structure based toolkits to analyze and visualize the odorant molecules.
- A AI model based on Ative Learning to train/predict new odorant molecules by the customized preferences.
- A data colletion for the vendors of providing the fragrances online.
